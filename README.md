# EC463 Mini Project

This mini-project is a temperature and humidity sensor simulator. It is built for Android OS using Android Studio with the help of the Google Authentication API, Google Firestore and MPAndroid Chart.

The final apk has been parsed. This can be downloaded and used to run the application on any Android device.


*Design
The database was built with NoSql and was structured. So for every collection of locations, there was simulated data on the temperature and humidity at various timestamps.


**Testing
First the user signs up/logs in, then the location is chosen and finally there is the option to check the temperature or humidity for that location. The data is shown as a simulated plot.
