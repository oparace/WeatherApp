<p>This mini-project is a temperature and humidity sensor simulator. It is built for Android OS using Android Studio with the help of the Google Authentication API, Google Firestore and MPAndroid Chart.</p>
<p>The final apk has been parsed. This can be downloaded and used to run the application on any Android device.</p>
<p>*Design
The database was built with NoSql and was structured. So for every collection of locations, there was simulated data on the temperature and humidity at various timestamps.</p>
<p>**Testing
First the user signs up/logs in, then the location is chosen and finally there is the option to check the temperature or humidity for that location. The data is shown as a simulated plot.</p>
<p>***I worked alone on this project.</p>
